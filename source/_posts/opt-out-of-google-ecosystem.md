## Chrome:

Since version 69, Chrome started to auto sign into your Google account in Chrome. You can switch to Firefox

## Gmail:

Google will read your email content. You can switch to ProtonEmail (protonmail.com)

## Search Engine:

Unfortunately, now there is no better search engine than Google, but that doesn't mean you could lose your privacy, startpage.com is a good option, under the hood, it still uses Google to get the search result, but will hide your identity.

## Youtube:

Unfortunately, if you browse youtube very often to watch videos, there isn't a good alternative. However, if you use Youtube as a video hosting service, you could switch to Vimeo.

## Android:

Apparently, the only switching option for this would be using iPhone, but if you are not a big fan of recent iPhone's design (with the ugly notch), you will most likely keep using an Android phone, if so, make sure you give each app the right permission in system settings.

## Google Activity Settings:

This one probably is the most important one, go to myactivity.google.com, turn off all the tracker switches.
